Project Folder Structure:-
1. All the code related files are inside the src folder
2. src has 3 folders in it:
 (1) js :: All the javascript files related to the html files are in here.
 (2) resources :: All the bootstrap and related js files are in here.Plugins need to be put in here.
 (3) view :: These are all the html files related to the project
3. The src also has the python files.
     - The main python file is the bottle_server.py through which the bottle server runs.
	 - We need to make a separate python for each module to run. eg: login module (everything related to login)
	 - the bottle_server file should be used only for navigation.
