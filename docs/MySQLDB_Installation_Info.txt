My SQL db:
got the instructions here : https://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2010/install-mysql-on-fedora-centos-red-hat-rhel/
1. installed the mysql yum repository:-
yum localinstall https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm

2. install mysql 5.7.20 :- (latest currently)
keep a watch on it coz it asks you "ok or not" a couple of times

3. After it installs start the service using:
systemctl start mysqld.service

4. Get the default root password:- Imp 
grep 'A temporary password is generated for root@localhost' /var/log/mysqld.log |tail -1
default root password::::  QDRw<>DiX4oz

5.To login to mysql database type:
 mysql -u root -p
 root password: QDRw<>DiX4oz  (or whatever the grep command gives)
this should give the mysql prompt

6. to change the default password for the root:
 (1) Login to the mysql prompt with root and default password
 (2) in the mysql prompt type in :: ALTER USER CURRENT_USER IDENTIFIED BY '<new password>' PASSWORD EXPIRE; 
 (I have currently set it to DBMasters<>123)
 (3) exit to quite mysql
 

So currently the user is : root
password is              : DBMasters<>123

have also created a database named : ProjectDatabase;
